# DoubleLinkedList

## What the project does
This project implements a double-linked list to manage a collection of players. It supports efficient insertion, deletion, and bidirectional traversal of players, allowing nodes to be added or removed from both the head and tail of the list.

## Why the project is useful
The double-linked list enables:

- **O(1) insertion and deletion** at both the head and tail, optimizing performance.
- **Efficient traversal in both directions**, making it ideal for scenarios where reverse iteration or flexible node removal is necessary.
